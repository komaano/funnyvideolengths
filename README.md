# funnyvideolengths
Modifies metadata of mp4 and webms to produce funny results. 

# Usage
Build the solution, then provide a webm or mp4 to the program in the command prompt as an argument. 
The outputted file will be "{filename}\_fuckedup.mp4/webm". Webms will appear to have an increasing video length while mp4s will have a stupidly long video length-- at least in Discord.
